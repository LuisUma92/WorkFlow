# Work Flow

This package contains a set of scripts that I use form writing my tesis


## NoRI - Note Reference Insertion

Script that search for study summary files, fallowing an specific structure
on [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file format, and look for notes on the files.
It returns a string output to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), the note structure
on the summary file indicates whether is paraphrase o verbatim, so that inset
a $\LaTeX$ quotation reference respectively.

### Directory expected structure

```
ROOT
├── master.tex
├── master.bib
├── lib
│   ├── bibkey-title.pdf
│   └── ...
├── lec
│   ├── lec_00.tex

    └── tex.snippets
```

### lib2bib

This script compares all files on lib directory with entries
on master.bib file. If a document on lib directory don't 
have a bib entries it proceed to create one.

### PRISMA 2020 - Register Structure

We use [PRIMA 2020](http://www.prisma-statement.org) for a
systematic review of the scientific article. This protocol
establishes the items to record for each Article Register.
This script interacts with a Data Base where Registers are
recorded.

#### Documentation

This library interacts via CLI and ask to input item by item,
then send the information to the DataBase. More info on (myPRISMA documentation)[myPRISMA.md]

#### To do list

- An interaction to the data base for Summary Notes creation.
- Bib automatic update.

### Summary Notes structure

The summary consist of easy access files that provides the 
notes, connections, ideas and other kinds of information
useful when writing essays.
